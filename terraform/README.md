# Terraform
In this folder the infrastructure in AWS is created and the docker image for the lambda function is built via terraform.
## Setup
To use the functionality of pushing the lambda image directly to ECR you need to install the [amazon-ecr-credentials-helper](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper).
